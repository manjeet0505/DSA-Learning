JAVASCRIPT INTERVIEW NOTES (INTERVIEW READY)
====================================================

-----------------------
BASICS
-----------------------

1. What is JavaScript?
- High-level, interpreted, dynamically typed language
- Used to create interactive web applications
- Works on both frontend (browser) and backend (Node.js)

2. Is JavaScript compiled or interpreted?
- Interpreted language
- Modern engines use JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation

3. Is JavaScript single-threaded?
- Yes, JavaScript is single-threaded
- Handles async tasks using Event Loop

4. Difference between Java and JavaScript
- Java: class-based, strongly typed
- JavaScript: prototype-based, dynamically typed

-----------------------
VARIABLES & SCOPE
-----------------------

5. var vs let vs const
- var: function scoped, hoisted with undefined, can redeclare
- let: block scoped, hoisted but in TDZ, cannot redeclare
- const: block scoped, must initialize, no reassignment

6. What is scope?
- Scope defines where variables are accessible
- Types: Global, Function, Block

7. Lexical scope
- Scope depends on where code is written
- JavaScript follows lexical scoping

8. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
- Time between declaration and initialization of let/const
- Accessing variable in TDZ throws error

9. Shadowing
- Inner variable hides outer variable with same name
- Allowed with let/const, risky with var

-----------------------
OPERATORS & TYPES
-----------------------

10. == vs ===
- == compares value only (type coercion)
- === compares value and type
- Always prefer ===

11. Truthy and Falsy values
- Falsy: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN
- Truthy: everything else

12. null vs undefined
- undefined: variable declared but not assigned
- null: intentional empty value

13. typeof null
- typeof null returns "object"
- This is a known JavaScript bug

14. NaN
- Stands for Not a Number
- Result of invalid numeric operations
- NaN !== NaN

-----------------------
FUNCTIONS
-----------------------

15. What is a function?
- Block of reusable code
- Executes when called

16. Function declaration vs expression
- Declaration is hoisted
- Expression is not hoisted

17. Arrow function
- Shorter syntax
- Does not have its own this

18. What is this keyword?
- Refers to current execution context
- Depends on how function is called

19. Call Stack
- Tracks function execution order
- Stack overflow occurs due to deep recursion

-----------------------
HOISTING & CLOSURE
-----------------------

20. What is hoisting?
- Moving declarations to memory phase
- var initialized as undefined
- let/const in TDZ

21. What is closure?
- Inner function remembers outer function variables
- Exists even after outer function execution

22. Uses of closure
- Data hiding
- Private variables
- Callbacks
- Currying

-----------------------
ASYNC JAVASCRIPT
-----------------------

23. What is asynchronous JavaScript?
- Code that does not block execution
- Examples: setTimeout, fetch, promises

24. What is Event Loop?
- Manages async operations
- Moves tasks from queue to call stack

25. Callback
- Function passed as argument to another function

26. Callback Hell
- Nested callbacks
- Makes code unreadable

27. Promise
- Object representing future value
- States: pending, fulfilled, rejected

28. async / await
- Cleaner way to handle promises
- Built on top of promises

-----------------------
ARRAYS & OBJECTS
-----------------------

29. Primitive vs Non-Primitive
- Primitive: stored by value (number, string, boolean)
- Non-Primitive: stored by reference (array, object)

30. Shallow copy vs Deep copy
- Shallow: copies reference
- Deep: creates new independent copy

31. map vs forEach
- map returns new array
- forEach does not return anything

32. filter
- Returns array elements that satisfy condition

33. reduce
- Reduces array to single value

34. delete operator
- Used to delete object properties

-----------------------
PROTOTYPE & INHERITANCE
-----------------------

35. Prototype
- Mechanism for sharing properties between objects
- Used for inheritance

36. Prototype chain
- JavaScript searches property in object then prototype chain

37. Does JavaScript support inheritance?
- Yes, via prototype-based inheritance

-----------------------
MISC INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
-----------------------

38. Is JavaScript case-sensitive?
- Yes

39. What is garbage collection?
- Automatic memory management in JavaScript

40. Can closures cause memory leaks?
- Yes, if unused references are retained

41. What are template literals?
- Strings using backticks with ${} interpolation

42. Higher-order function
- Function that takes or returns another function

43. setTimeout vs setInterval
- setTimeout runs once
- setInterval runs repeatedly

44. Can we stop setInterval?
- Yes, using clearInterval

45. What is strict mode?
- Enforces stricter parsing and error handling

-----------------------
INTERVIEW GOLDEN RULES
-----------------------

- Prefer const over let
- Avoid var
- Use === instead of ==
- Understand examples, not definitions
- Explain with confidence, not speed
