Interview me sorting itna important kyun?

Because sorting = problem simplifier.

Sorting ke baad:

Comparisons easy ho jaate hain

Nearest elements paas aa jaate hain

Two pointers possible ho jaate hain

Greedy decisions valid ho jaate hain

Interview line:

   Sorting transforms the problem into a structured form where greedy or two-pointer techniques become applicable.
