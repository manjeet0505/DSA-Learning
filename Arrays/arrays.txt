ARRAY
Continuous Memory
Fixed Size
Index-Based Access
O(1) Access Time
Direct Access fast hota hai
Traversal linear hota hai



BASIC ARRAY TRAVERSAL
Reverse Array
Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)
Check if Array is Sorted and Rotated
Time = O(n)
Space = O(1)
Kth Largest
Time = O(n log n)
Due to sorting
Find Duplicate
Time = O(n log n)
Due to sorting




TWO POINTER
Two pointer technique uses two indices moving towards each other (or forward) to reduce redundant comparisons.

# Move negatives to one side 
In this type of problem we can also have asked to move negatives without breaking the order of the elements.
# Remove duplicates from sorted Array
# Two Sum 
# Rearrangement of +ve and -ve alternatively



#Sliding Window
