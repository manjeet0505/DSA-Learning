# Kadane’s Algorithm — Exact Scope 

This document clearly defines **what Kadane’s Algorithm covers and what it does NOT**.  
Use this to avoid pattern confusion in interviews and practice.

---
##  Kadane Covers ONLY These (Non-DP Zone)

### 1️⃣ Maximum Subarray Sum
**Classic Kadane Problem**

- Goal: Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- Core formula:

currentSum = max(arr[i], currentSum + arr[i])


- Intuition:
  - Either start fresh from current element
  - Or extend the previous subarray
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

---

### 2️⃣ All Negative Array Case
- Edge case of Kadane
- When all elements are negative:
  - The answer is the **largest (least negative) element**
- Important interview check

---

### 3️⃣ Maximum Product Subarray
**Modified Kadane**

- Trick:
  - Maintain both `maxProduct` and `minProduct`
  - Because negative × negative = positive
- Still a Kadane-family problem (not DP)

---

### 4️⃣ Buy & Sell Stock (Kadane Mindset)

####  Single Transaction
- Equivalent to Kadane on price differences
- Idea:
  - Drop bad prefix (loss)
  - Keep maximum profit

####  Multiple Transactions
- Greedy extension of Kadane thinking
- Still **NOT DP**

 These stock problems belong to the **Kadane family**

---

##  What is NOT Kadane (IMPORTANT)

These are **Dynamic Programming problems**, not Kadane:

- Buy & Sell Stock with cooldown
- Buy & Sell Stock with transaction fee
- Buy & Sell Stock with at most K transactions
- Maximum Circular Subarray  
  (Kadane + extra trick, advanced variant)

 Avoid mixing these with Kadane during interviews.

---

##  From Interviewer’s Perspective

If the interviewer asks:

> “Explain Kadane’s Algorithm”

They expect you to cover:

- Maximum Subarray Sum
- Negative prefix drop intuition
- Edge case: all negative numbers
- (Bonus) Maximum Product Subarray

 Anything beyond this is **extra**, not mandatory.

---

##  Final Takeaway

- Kadane = **Greedy, linear scan**
- Kadane ≠ DP
- If state transitions or multiple decisions exist → it’s DP, not Kadane
